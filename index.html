              <h3 class="athlete__name">Luke Turpin</h3>
              <p>
                Luke, 8 years old, was diagnosed with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia on October 24, 2024. He seemed healthy at first, but swollen lymph nodes prompted his pediatrician to order blood tests. The results came back fast and devastating. Luke had leukemia and was rushed to Riley Hospital for immediate treatment.

              </p>
              <p>
                Further testing revealed a mass in his chest pressing against his airway and aorta. He was quickly moved to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) for specialized care. The situation was critical, and the medical team responded with urgency.
              
              </p>
              <p>
                Luke’s treatment has been grueling. Chemotherapy caused him to lose 17% of his body weight, leaving him weak and struggling to recover. Things worsened when an undiagnosed infection led to endocarditis, forcing a six-week course of antibiotics delivered through his port. So far, he’s spent about two and a half months in the hospital which is an intense stretch that shows just how serious his condition has been.

          <p>
            The David Tucker Memorial Golf Classic honors its namesake, David Tucker, a man who met lung cancer with remarkable courage until his passing in 2021. David was a devoted husband, father, brother, and friend. He was also a gifted athlete, an inspiring coach, and a mentor whose impact continues to ripple through the lives he touched.

          </p>
          <p>
            More than anything, David was driven by a deep commitment to helping others, especially young people and families across Indiana. Even in the midst of his own battle, his focus stayed on the kids he coached and mentored. Many of them are now chasing their own dreams, shaped by his example and encouragement. At 6 feet 11 inches, David was impossible to overlook, but it was his integrity, warmth, and generosity that truly made him stand tall.

          </p>
          <p>
            Tucker Tournaments was founded to honor David’s legacy and keep his mission alive. These events reflect the values he lived by and continue his work of supporting children and families affected by cancer. Proceeds go toward easing the weight of medical bills or helping grant a special wish for a child in treatment or recovery, bringing light even in the darkest times, just like David always did.

          </p>
          <p>
            All proceeds from this scramble help local youth currently battling cancer or in remission.

          </p>
          <p>            
            Join us for a great day on the course and make a difference!
